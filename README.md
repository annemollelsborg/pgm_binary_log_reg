# PGM Binary logistic regression
By leveraging a probabilistic graphical model (PGM), the aim is to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company based on a variety of demographic, job-related, and behavioral factors. The model will capture direct influences and include them in a binary logistic regression, predicting whether an employee is likely to resign.
